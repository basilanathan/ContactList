Basila Nathan's iOS Belt Exam. This project was built in 4.5 hours.

Belt Exams are how Coding Dojo gauges whether a student has mastered the material in a certain stack. In order to gauge this, we give our students a wireframe, a list of requirements that an application must do, and the technologies that the student must use to build it. We then give said student 4.5 hours to complete the application. If the application meets all requirements the student passes, if not they fail.
